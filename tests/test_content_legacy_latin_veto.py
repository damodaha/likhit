"""Tests for the Latin-side veto on the content-legacy remap (VOL-138).

The remap these guard is decided per **font**, on that font's aggregate text across
the whole document (:func:`detect_content_legacy_fonts`). That is the right unit for
deciding whether a face is a mislabeled legacy 8-bit font, and it is deliberately
left alone here. What it cannot do is notice that *some* spans of that face are
genuine Latin: OAG's 2077 performance audit report renders the real acronym ``QOC``
as ``त्तइऋ`` and loses 1,362 characters of an English appendix, because both sit in
the same ``Spins`` resource as 3,593 characters of real Preeti keystrokes (VOL-126).

**Why this needs its own tests rather than a purity assertion.** The corruption is
invisible to every existing check by construction. A character map turns ASCII
letters into Devanagari letters whatever the input language was, so remapped English
scores ``penalty 0`` and ``ratio 1.0`` — identical to correctly-decoded Nepali. It
raises Devanagari and lowers Latin, which is the direction four of v11's legitimate
fixes also move, so no delta class can see it either. The only evidence is in the
raw ASCII, before the substitution, which is what :func:`_reads_as_latin_text`
reads.

**Both directions are guarded, and the second one is the one that bites.** A veto
that is too eager is not a safe failure: it abandons real Nepali as visible ASCII
garbage. The first version of this axis — letter-share only, as originally proposed
— fired on **13,429** of the corpus's 469,357 remapped runs to protect 273, because
symbol-free Preeti keystrokes are all-ASCII-letter strings and a letter-share axis
is structurally blind to them. So the keystroke cases below are not decoration; they
are the calibration's actual failure mode, taken verbatim from the corpus sweep.

"""Every module-level numeric constant in ``src/``, pinned to its measured value.

MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Each of the 23 constants below was perturbed in place and the
whole suite run against the mutant. **14 of the 23 survived** -- nothing in the suite
asserted anything that depended on the value, so a reviewer could change any of them
and see green. Among the survivors were the CID marking base, the threshold that routes
a page to paid OCR, and the table-cell edge tolerance.

That figure is the measurement against the suite WITHOUT this file. Re-run against this
file, all 23 are caught and 0 survive. Both numbers are needed: the first says why the
file exists, the second says it works. The sweep is `tools/constant_sweep.sh` in the run
record; the result is `inventory/constant-sweep.tsv`.

🛑 THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS FILE SHIPPED VACUOUS, and how is worth more than the fix.
`test_constant_holds_its_pinned_value` was committed with `expected` rebound to the live
module attribute -- a mutation marker, left in by the very sweep that was demonstrating
the vacuity. Three things had to line up, and all three are avoidable:

  1. The mutation was reverted with `git checkout -- tests/<this file>` while the file
     was still UNTRACKED. That command fails on an untracked path. It printed an error;
     the error was read as benign, because "the file is untracked" sounded like an
     explanation rather than the reason the restore did not happen.
  2. The restore was then confirmed by re-running the suite and seeing green. Green
     after a restore proves nothing when the mutation is one that makes tests PASS --
     which is exactly the class of mutation a vacuity demonstration uses.
  3. `git add -A tests` committed the mutant.

So: restore by byte comparison against a pristine copy, never by re-running the suite,
and never with `git checkout` on a path that may be untracked.
`test_no_pin_is_derived_from_the_thing_it_pins` now closes the specific hole -- the pin
could not detect its own vacuity, so the property is asserted over its source instead.

WHY A BARE PIN IS THE RIGHT SHAPE HERE, given that a pin asserts nothing about
behaviour: the alternative is a behavioural test per constant, and for a geometry
threshold that means inventing a fixture whose only purpose is to sit either side of a
number -- which pins the fixture, not the threshold. A pin plus a stated derivation
makes the value a decision with an owner. Three constants whose consequence is severe
enough to earn a behavioural test as well get one at the bottom of this file.

TWO THINGS THIS FILE IS CAREFUL ABOUT.

* **The registry is checked against an AST scan of the source**, so a constant added
  later must be registered. Pinning today's 23 would close 23 instances and leave the
  class open.
* **Every expected value is a literal.** A test that reads the constant to build its
  own expectation holds at any value -- which is exactly how these came to be
  unpinned. `tests/test_candidate_scoring.py` is the live example: its `_mark()` helper
  builds fixtures with `chr(_CID_MARK_BASE + ord(char))`, so moving the base moves the
  fixture with it. That file even states the principle in `_padding_crossover`'s
  docstring -- "a helper that recomputes the term cannot notice the term changing" --
  and applies it to the scorer while the helper nine lines above breaks it.

"""Tests for VOL-218's mixed letter+digit margin gate on the legacy map chooser.

**What the gate is for.** The six legacy maps fall into two families that swap the
number rows: ``Preeti``/``Kantipur``/``Sagarmatha``/``Spins`` put the Devanagari
digits on the SHIFTED row ``!@#$%^&*()`` and read ``0123456789`` as consonants, while
``PCS NEPALI``/``FONTASY_HIMALI_TT`` do the reverse. Choosing the wrong family
therefore does not *garble* a span, it TRANSPOSES letters and digits -- and on a
document that types money on one row and place names on the other, a single wrong
choice produces both directions at once.

That is what happened to ``3719__...Humla Sarkegad`` on v13 -> v14. Its ``Felix
Titling`` face flipped ``PCS NEPALI`` -> ``Preeti``, and in one table 49
unshifted-row keystrokes became consonants (``?= 10875.00`` -> ``ru. ...``, the money
column) while 23 shifted-row keystrokes became digits (``uf]&L`` -> ``go-7-i`` for
``gothi``, a place name). Measured in ``oag-corpus/runs/vol218/`` and recorded in
``FINDING-16``/``FINDING-19``.

**Why nothing else catches it.** A wrong-family reading scores ``penalty 0`` and a
high ``ratio``, because every keystroke still lands on Devanagari. On this face all
six maps tie on ``hits``, ``penalty``, ``stranded`` AND ``attested``, so the decision
fell through to ``ratio``, where ``Preeti`` won by **0.000391** -- inside the band the
ranking's own docstring calls unusable. The document-level attested screen saw only
``net_attested_delta -2``, because seven gained ``ru`` nearly cancelled the loss.

**Why a MARGIN and not just another axis.** The bare term was priced corpus-wide
first: below ``attested`` it costs nothing but leaves ``4834...kharpunath`` damaged;
above ``attested`` it repairs all four damaged documents but takes ``attested -5`` and
makes four flips that are not repairs, because it speaks on spans where its advantage
is a single token. Gated on a margin it makes 6 flips at M=5 -- a strict subset of the
ungated 11 -- keeps all four repairs, and costs ``attested -2``, all of which is one
document's own repair.

**The gate is OPT-IN and OFF by default**, because which margin ships is an open board
decision. The first test below is the one that matters most: with the gate off the
chooser must be indistinguishable from the shipped one.

"""Every path a Markdown doc points at must exist, be deliberately absent, or be pending.

Two kinds of reference, and the second is the one that matters here.

* ``[text](path)`` links. A conventional link checker covers these.
* **Backticked repo-relative paths** -- ``` `tests/test_foo.py` ``` -- which a link
  checker does not see at all. `docs/writing-tests.md` cross-references two test files
  that way, so the constraint "land the docs after the tests they name" was held only in
  a pull-request body. Pull-request bodies are not in the tree.

That is the doc's own thesis applied to itself: a guard is only as wide as the set of
places it looks.

Three things a naive version of this test gets wrong, all found by writing it:

1. **A line-cite is not a path.** ``` `src/likhit/extractors/legacy_maps.py:26` ``` is a
   legitimate way to point at a line, and a trailing ``:NN`` has to be stripped before
   the path is checked.
2. **Some paths are deliberately absent.** `docs/cib-press-release-extraction.md`
   correctly documents `tests/fixtures/cib/`, which is git-ignored (PII) and present on
   nobody's checkout. A doc naming it is right, not stale.
3. **A pending reference must expire.** A doc may name a file a sibling change adds. That
   is allowed once, declared, and only until the file exists -- see `_PENDING`.

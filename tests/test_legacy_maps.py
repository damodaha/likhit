# Where the gate is applied, and why that is narrower than it first looks.
#
# The gate does not consult the map -- it translates the raw ASCII digits and emits
# literal parens, rewriting the whole span on VOL-166's premise that none of it was
# typed on the layout. So the restriction below is NOT a precondition the gate
# depends on. It is a restriction on where that premise has been checked:
#
#   digit-row maps (PCS NEPALI, FONTASY_HIMALI_TT)
#       the shape occurs and is demonstrably literal numbering -- 168 markers over
#       the 13 CIAA annual reports, 168 of 168 sitting in lines whose other spans
#       already carry Unicode Devanagari.
#
#   consonant-row maps (Preeti, Kantipur, Sagarmatha)
#       the shape does NOT occur in the corpus. Rewriting "(5)" there would emit
#       "(५)" where the map reads "९छ०" -- a digit in place of a letter, on no
#       evidence either way. So the gate is declined, and the tests below pin that
#       CHOICE rather than claiming "९छ०" is the correct reading.
#
# The restriction is therefore a no-op on every document measured. It matters for the
# un-anchored form of the gate, which would fire on substrings under every map.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #


# Hard-coded on purpose rather than read back out of the map: this is the pin on
# npttf2utf's vendored map.json, so if that file is revendored with a different
# number row we find out here instead of in a corpus diff. Deriving the
# expectation from the same table it means to pin would pin nothing.

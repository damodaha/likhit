"""Builders for small, PII-free synthetic PDFs used by the scanned-PDF tests.

These reproduce the structural signatures that the real (git-ignored, PII-bearing)
Nepal Police CIB press releases exhibit, so the detection logic can be exercised
in CI without shipping the sensitive originals:

- a scanned raster whose only text is a non-embedded core-font "decoy" layer,
- a pure image-only raster with no text layer,
- a bare Latin core font that actually carries legacy (Preeti) keystrokes,
- the same legacy keystrokes under a subsetter-generated font name, the Spins
  layout under that name, and the negative (ordinary English under it),
- a mixed document with one scanned page and one born-digital page.

Everything is generated with PyMuPDF's built-in Helvetica (a non-embedded
standard-14 core font, exactly like the CIB decoy) and a flat gray placeholder
image, so no real document, font file, or personal data is involved. The
subset-named builders additionally rewrite ``/BaseFont`` after the fact, which
changes the name and nothing else.

# likhit

`likhit` is Jawafdehi's public MarkItDown plugin for Nepal-specific document support.

It extends [MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) with Nepal-specific PDF repair, layout-aware Markdown assembly, optional OCR fallback for image-dominant PDFs, and legacy `.doc` support. For PDFs, `likhit` now evaluates multiple extraction paths and returns the best result instead of relying on a single fixed pipeline.

Owned and maintained by [Jawafdehi](https://jawafdehi.org/).

## Installation

```bash
pip install likhit
```

## Usage

`likhit` is primarily used as a [MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) plugin.

### Python

Once installed, enable plugins when creating a `MarkItDown` instance:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=True)
result = md.convert("path/to/nepali-document.pdf")
print(result.text_content)
```

### MarkItDown CLI

You can also use `likhit` through the standard MarkItDown CLI:

```bash
markitdown --use-plugins path/to/nepali-document.pdf
```

To write the output to a file:

```bash
markitdown --use-plugins path/to/nepali-document.pdf -o output.md
```

To verify the plugin is registered:

```bash
markitdown --list-plugins
```

You should see `likhit` in the output.

### `likhit-save` CLI

This package also installs a small helper CLI that runs MarkItDown with the `likhit` plugin enabled and writes Markdown files for you:

```bash
likhit-save path/to/nepali-document.pdf --out output.md
```

Convert multiple files into a directory:

```bash
likhit-save samples/pressrelease.pdf samples/kanunpatrika.pdf --out-dir converted/
```

Extract only one page or a page range from a PDF:

```bash
likhit-save path/to/nepali-document.pdf --pages 5 --out page-5.md
likhit-save path/to/nepali-document.pdf --pages 2-4 --out pages-2-4.md
```

### What likhit does

`likhit` adds behavior beyond MarkItDown in these places:

- **PDF**: `likhit` intercepts PDF inputs, runs the default MarkItDown PDF converter first, and then decides whether to keep that result, retry with Nepal-specific extraction, or add an OCR candidate for image-dominant pages. It prefers direct `likhit` extraction immediately when known Nepali repair fonts are detected.
- **DOC**: Legacy Microsoft Word `.doc` files are handled by `likhit`'s own extraction pipeline.
- **DOCX**: `.docx` files are still handled by MarkItDown's built-in Word converter, even when plugins are enabled.

### Supported document types
- PDFs, including Nepal-specific born-digital PDFs and image-dominant PDFs that may need OCR
- Legacy `.doc` files
- `.docx` passthrough via MarkItDown


### OCR Configuration

For image-dominant or scanned PDFs, `likhit` can add an OCR extraction candidate through `markitdown-ocr` when OCR is configured.

Required model configuration:

```bash
export MARKITDOWN_OCR_MODEL="your-model-name"
```

You can also provide the model through `OPENAI_MODEL` or `GEMINI_MODEL`.

Authentication options:

1. OpenAI-compatible provider with a standard OpenAI key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

2. OpenAI-compatible provider with a custom base URL:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://your-provider.example/v1/"
export MARKITDOWN_OCR_MODEL="your-model-name"
```

3. Gemini using the OpenAI compatibility endpoint:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"
```

When `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, `likhit` automatically uses Gemini's OpenAI-compatible base URL unless you explicitly override `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.

Optional variables:

```bash
export MARKITDOWN_OCR_PROMPT="Custom OCR instructions"
```

#### Recipe: a vision model on your own machine

Ollama, llama.cpp and vLLM all serve an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so no `likhit`
change is needed — and no page image leaves the machine:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:7b

# Ollama ignores the key; the client refuses to start without one
export OPENAI_API_KEY="ollama"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"
export MARKITDOWN_OCR_MODEL="qwen2.5vl:7b"

likhit-save scanned-notice.pdf --out notice.md
```

#### Recipe: AWS Bedrock, through a gateway

Bedrock does not speak the OpenAI API, so put a translating proxy in front of it.
The proxy resolves AWS credentials the usual way — `AWS_PROFILE`, environment
variables or an instance role — and `likhit` only ever sees an OpenAI endpoint:

```bash
pip install 'litellm[proxy]'
litellm --model bedrock/anthropic.claude-sonnet-5

# whatever you configured the proxy to accept
export OPENAI_API_KEY="local-proxy-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1"
export MARKITDOWN_OCR_MODEL="bedrock/anthropic.claude-sonnet-5"
```

Any vision-capable model your account has enabled will do; swap the model id for
one you have access to.

#### When OCR actually runs

`likhit` adds an OCR candidate only for pages whose text layer cannot serve them
(see [Architecture](#architecture) below), so configuring a vision backend does
not mean paying for one on every document. In the published benchmark, 13 of 16
Government of Nepal documents are converted without a single vision call; only the
image-only scans need one.

If OCR is left unconfigured, `likhit` still converts. It logs that a page needed
OCR and returns the best result it could reach without it, rather than failing:

```text
PDF converter: OCR appears necessary, but OCR is not configured.
Set OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY, plus MARKITDOWN_OCR_MODEL, to enable markitdown-ocr.
```

## Architecture

The high-level PDF pipeline is:

1. MarkItDown loads the plugin when `enable_plugins=True` or `--use-plugins` is used.
2. For PDF inputs, `likhit` reads the file and optionally slices it to the requested page range.
3. `likhit` scans embedded fonts. If it detects known Nepali repair fonts such as Kalimati broken-CMap fonts or legacy remap fonts, it tries the Nepal-specific extraction pipeline immediately.
4. `likhit` also runs the default MarkItDown PDF converter and keeps that result as a candidate.
5. `likhit` analyzes the PDF pages. If the file looks image-dominant with a suspicious text layer and OCR is configured, it adds an OCR candidate.
6. If the default Markdown output looks suspicious for Nepali text, `likhit` retries extraction with its own PDF pipeline.
7. The Nepal-specific PDF pipeline can apply:
   - Kalimati broken-CMap repair
   - Devanagari reordering
   - Devanagari spacing normalization
   - Legacy-font remapping through `npttf2utf`
8. After extraction, `likhit` checks whether the document matches a whole-document semantic structure such as a single-column notice.
9. PDF layout ordering is assigned locally while assembling content blocks, so single-column, row-aligned, and two-column regions can coexist in one file.
10. If multiple candidate outputs exist, `likhit` scores them and returns the best one.

## Development

`likhit` uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management, and the
rest of Astral's toolchain — [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and
formatting, [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) for type checking.

Install the project together with its dev dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

Install the pre-commit hooks once per clone:
```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run only the end-to-end integration suite:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/integration
```

**Read [`docs/writing-tests.md`](docs/writing-tests.md) before adding one.** `likhit`
reads adversarial input, and several classes of defect here are invisible to a suite
that merely passes — that file covers how to prove a test bites, and the
library-specific traps a test can be blind to.

Ten tests skip on a clean checkout, and they are three different things:

| skips | why |
|---|---|
| 5 | real CIB fixtures — git-ignored (PII), absent locally and in CI |
| 3 | `LIKHIT_LOHIT_REFERENCE_TTF` unset |
| 2 | `LIKHIT_KALIMATI_REFERENCE_TTF` unset |

Only the first group is unavoidable. The other five compare glyph mappings against
upstream reference fonts, so they are the tests most likely to catch a mapping
regression — set the variable if you are touching `lohit.py` or
`kalimati_reference.py`.

### Gates

CI runs the following. Run them yourself before opening a pull request:

```bash
uv run ruff check .           # lint — gated
uv run ruff format --check .  # formatting — gated
uv run pytest                 # tests — gated
uv run ty check               # types — ADVISORY, see pyproject.toml
```

`ty` is advisory rather than a gate: it is pre-1.0, and several of this package's
dependencies (PyMuPDF among them) ship no type information, so the rule families
it cannot yet see through are silenced in `pyproject.toml`. Read its output; do
not ignore it.

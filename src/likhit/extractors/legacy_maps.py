# Font name -> npttf2utf map key. A font NAME is only ever a hint about the encoding
# the bytes actually use, and for one family the hint is wrong: names in the "Himalb"
# family carry PREETI-encoded bytes while naming Himali.
#
# Preeti and FONTASY_HIMALI_TT are near-clones that EXCHANGE their two number rows --
# each map's unshifted digit row is the other's shifted row, exactly (asserted in
# tests/test_legacy_maps.py). So the wrong one of the pair is silently destructive in
# both directions: it puts a Devanagari digit inside a word, and it puts a consonant
# where a year belongs. Neither shows up as damage -- both characters are Devanagari,
# so there is no U+FFFD, no drop in the Devanagari ratio, and no garble tell.
#
# Measured over the 13 CIAA annual reports, per name rather than pooled -- pooling is
# what made the first version of this correction move two names too many:
#
#   name           spans   alpha chars   in-word Devanagari digits
#                                        under Preeti   under FONTASY_HIMALI_TT
#   Himalb         15,831       30,258              0                    1,021
#   Himalb,Bold     2,360        9,243              0                      417
#
# 1,438 corruptions under the shipped routing, none under Preeti. "spans" counts text
# spans whose font name reaches the "himalb" key; "alpha chars" counts ASCII ALPHABETIC
# keystrokes in those spans (not total characters, which are 87,020 and 18,767).
#
# The cost, measured on the same spans rather than assumed. All 6 "-N_" list markers in
# these spans get WORSE: both maps read '-'/'_' as the real brackets, but the interior
# digit becomes a consonant, so "(५)" -> "(छ)" in every one of the six -- checked
# individually, Preeti's marker carries no Devanagari digit in any of them. Zero
# whole-span ASCII "(N)" markers are affected, so the gate below loses nothing.
#
# Against that, 4 of those 6 spans carry a body beyond the marker and 3 of the 4 bodies
# are REPAIRED, e.g. "भि८ियो ... सीसी६ीभीको" -> "भिडियो ... सीसीटीभीको". So the trade is
# 6 marker digits for 3 repaired bodies plus the 1,438 above.
#
# 🛑 The discriminator used above is BLIND to a numeral-only font: with no surrounding
# letters a pure-numeral span scores zero under BOTH maps, so "0 under Preeti" means
# "no evidence", not "clean". The "Fontasy*" spellings carry 1 and 0 ASCII alphabetic
# keystrokes across 26,699 and 19,744 characters of span text, so nothing here licenses
# moving them and they stay on the Himali map. A metric that cannot tell *clean* from
# *not applicable* must not be read as support.

# (whose '(' key decodes to '९'); both layouts render a real bracket from '-'
# instead. So when a whole span is nothing but an ASCII-bracketed number -- a
# list/outline marker like "(1)" -- the parens were placed directly by
# whatever authored the numbering, sharing the body font only for visual
# consistency with the digit, not typed on this keyboard layout at all.

    This is the precondition of the gate above, and it does **not** hold for every

        PCS NEPALI, FONTASY_HIMALI_TT       ->  "०१२३४५६७८९"
        Preeti, Kantipur, Sagarmatha        ->  "ण्ज्ञद्दघद्धछटठडढ"

        Preeti            "(5)"  ->  "९छ०"    the interior IS the letter छ

    That is the whole warrant for the gate. It exists because the map gets the
    brackets wrong while getting the digit right, which is true of the first family
    only. Applied to the second it replaces a letter with a digit -- ``"(5)"``
    becomes ``"(५)"`` and the ``छ`` is **destroyed**, which is strictly worse than
    the defect the gate repairs.

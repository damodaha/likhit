    """Evidence axes for a candidate map, most decisive first, higher is better.

    ``hits`` and ``penalty`` are the calibrated primary axes. ``ratio`` and
    ``devanagari`` are tie-breaks only: a map that fits the face maps every
    keystroke onto Devanagari, so the residue a *wrong* map leaves behind shows up
    as non-Devanagari characters. That is what separates Spins from Preeti on a
    small span — Preeti reads Spins' ``_`` as a literal ``)`` where Spins produces
    the anusvara ``ं``.

    They sit strictly below ``penalty`` because a high Devanagari ratio on its
    own is a mirage (``test_nepali_validity_flags_garble_low``): converting ASCII
    digits into Devanagari digits also raises it, which is exactly what the
    ``Spins_EXT`` companion faces do under the map that is wrong for them. Those
    are excluded by ``hits``, not by this key. One OAG municipality report
    (``4487__…बसबरिया गाउँपालिका``, font ``Spins``, 2,156 characters) is a live
    instance: ``Spins`` there reads 0.69 Devanagari against ``PCS NEPALI``'s 0.68
    and is nonetheless the wrong map, carrying 48 penalty points to PCS NEPALI's
    zero. So ``ratio`` must not be promoted above the garble axis (VOL-89).

    **The garble axis is the raw count, not the per-Devanagari rate (VOL-89).**
    Every candidate here decodes *the same input span*, so the counts are already
    on a common scale and normalising them adds nothing — worse, it injects the
    denominator as a phantom signal. With the numerator held equal,
    ``penalty_per_deva`` is a monotone function of the Devanagari *count*, so it
    silently becomes the ``devanagari`` axis while ranking above both ``ratio``
    and ``devanagari``. That is not hypothetical: on
    ``3222__…faktalung ga.pa`` (font ``Spins``, 757 characters) all six maps score
    an identical raw penalty of **18**, and ``PCS NEPALI`` won only because
    18/576 < 18/562 — a denominator difference, not a garble difference — which
    rendered ``;_Vof`` as ``स)ख्या`` where the correct Spins read is ``संख्या``.

    Ranking on the raw count makes equal evidence an exact tie, so ``ratio``
    decides those spans, and it needs no epsilon or threshold to do it.
    ``penalty_per_deva`` remains the right statistic for
    :func:`_passes_content_legacy_gate`, which compares one span against an
    absolute ceiling and therefore does need cross-span comparability.

    :func:`_passes_content_legacy_gate`; otherwise the map key is ``None`` (the
    second element is the best-scoring validity for diagnostics).

    **The order of ALL_MAP_KEYS is not a tie-break.** It used to be, implicitly:
    the loop kept the first strict maximum, so two maps level on every axis were
    separated by whichever the tuple happened to list first. On small spans that
    decided real documents — a 303-character face in one OAG municipality report
    tied all six maps at ``hits=3, penalty=0.0`` and was decoded as Preeti purely
    because Preeti is index 0, rendering ``;_Vof`` as ``स)ख्या`` where the correct
    Spins read gives ``संख्या`` (VOL-77). Position in a tuple is not evidence, so
    a tie that survives every axis abstains instead: leaving the keystrokes
    visibly undecoded is recoverable, while well-formed Devanagari spelling the
    wrong word is not detectable by any purity axis or by a reader.

    Maps that produce *identical* text are not an ambiguity and do not abstain.
    Preeti, Kantipur and Sagarmatha decode much ordinary text the same way, and
    refusing to choose between two readings that do not differ would throw away
    a correct decode over a distinction without a difference.

    One consequence, deliberately left in place: for such a span the returned map
    *name* is still whichever of the equal candidates comes first in
    :data:`ALL_MAP_KEYS`. The decoded text cannot depend on that choice — the
    readings are equal by definition — so no transcript is affected, but the
    recorded map name is not a stable label for those spans and should not be read
    as an identification of the face. Making it stable would mean inventing a
    tie-break, which is the thing this function stopped doing.
